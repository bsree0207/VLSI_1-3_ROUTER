# VLSI_1-3_ROUTER
# Design and Verification of 1×3 Router Using UVM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and verification of a **1×3 VLSI Router**
using **RTL design methodology and UVM-based verification**.

Routers are critical components in modern digital communication systems and
Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures. The proposed router is designed to achieve
**high-speed data routing with low power consumption**.
